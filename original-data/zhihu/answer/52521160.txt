为什么外企全是中国HR却喜欢要求职者交英文简历？
No, you have some misunderstandings. Typing and reading in English actually saves energy and time for both sides. <br><br>Secondly, layout and alignments for English resumes are neat and tidy for intensive technical terms.<br><br>Something also important to me is that, while writing in English, applicants tend to have less bullshits.
