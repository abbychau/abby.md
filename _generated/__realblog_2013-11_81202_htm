<p>Every time swinging all over the world, I feel like readin'a cover of book<br />
Diving in the story of the world; Oh I can hear every feeling of you.<br />
Do you know all the choices you have? And-all-the-love written down in my words.<br />
Here is 'all my words and' all your choices. So empty your mind, and now go inside my mind.  </p>
<p>Get your chance to go-play inside the another world<br />
If you never try, you will never know how would your story to be written.<br />
So I let you make - good use of - this never dying soul<br />
You will never get hurt, my friend<br />
I was born for your own feeling, and your own adventure~~~  </p>
<p>Each of my names and the changing lines are the params of my life<br />
Half of my names will be known by you, you will want to find out all the others.<br />
Each of trolling ending ahhh..... they are not only your fault.<br />
When you know the author better and better, and you'll finally on th'right track to the good end.</p>
