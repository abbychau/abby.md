Your critter companion is the Cute Hybrid. What is<br />
it, you ask? Well, beats me, but its cute!<br />
And it suits your personality very well. You<br />
are a person who is very happy with your life<br />
and may sometimes be considered a teeny bit<br />
nave by others. Your innocence and<br />
kind-hearted nature make you a friend of anyone<br />
you meet, because you dont judge people based<br />
solely on appearance. You are a very unique<br />
individual.  </p>
