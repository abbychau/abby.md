<p>today when going to M core with Kristy and Clarice....<br />
佢地話, 個generation d 男仔咁矮...初中個陣d 高form 個d 都好高...<br />
and then...sights spot at me and said 覺得正常男仔應該有174/175.....</p>
<p>orz...who cares...i dunno why people like that height...<br />
一直都覺得高人會無咁好...所以係發育之前都唔想生咁高..<br />
相對於高人血壓會高d...身體負荷又重d... 跳舞又無咁好睇... 打功夫身手又無咁敏捷...行路跑步重心又高...唔通生咁高就係為左好睇d 咩...i don't mean anything...lol</p>
