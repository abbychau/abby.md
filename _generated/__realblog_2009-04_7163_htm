<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Koko Soko Asoko<br />
where are you my heart<br />
Koko Soko Asoko<br />
can't find you in the dark  </p>
<p>i'm looking for a friend<br />
who is lost in the dark<br />
can you help me find him<br />
he has lost his heart  </p>
<p>when he looks at me<br />
he tries to tell me where he is<br />
but I can't here please tell me now<br />
what is it that I miss  </p>
<p>Koko Soko Asoko<br />
where are you my heart<br />
Koko Soko Asoko<br />
can't find you in the dark<br />
Koko Soko Asoko<br />
please let me find you now<br />
Koko Soko Asoko<br />
then I try with this sound  </p>
<p>Ladidadidaida ladidaida<br />
Ladidadidaida ladidaida<br />
Ladidadidaida ladidaida<br />
Ladidadidaida ladidaida  </p>
<p>He tries to let me now*<br />
you gotta listen to your soul*<br />
find out what’s inside*<br />
than you gotta find this whole *<br />
i'm sitting there and wait for you*<br />
I want to be found*<br />
than we can play all night long*<br />
and make more of these sounds*</span>  </p>
