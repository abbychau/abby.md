<p>It's so late now.<br />
I go nowhere today and I can't do what I want to do. Stupid! What am I thinking of?  </p>
<p>Recently, I think of refusing someone but have no idea. Anyway I can just tell him the truth, but when?  </p>
<p>I am addicted to an online game these days. It is additive but in another word killing.</p>
