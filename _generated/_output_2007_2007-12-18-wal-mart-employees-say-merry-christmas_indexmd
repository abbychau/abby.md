<p>Following last year’s Wal-Mart controversy regarding religious issues over Christmas, the corporation announced to its employees Thursday that it is OK to once again greet shoppers by saying <strong>&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; instead of the generic &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>I will now shop at Walmart for the CHRISTMAS season. I also boycotted Walmart when I heard of their decision to implement &quot;Happy Holiday's&quot; instead of &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. My reponse has been in the past, and will continue to be, to reply to anyone who wishes me &quot;Happy Holiday's&quot;...I respond with &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. I will not say Happy Holiday's to anyone...and <strong>I won't buy any Christmas Cards that say nothing other than &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;. I don't EXPECT everyone to say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; to me, but as stated above, I always reply any greeting said to me with &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;</strong>. Hopefully corporate America will follow in Walmarts footsteps....Christ IS the center of the season.</p>
