<p>If I was killed by someone, who will be the next?  </p>
<p>Somebody gonna kill me in the restaurant in my estate and that was great! I was always thinking when will the one appears, that can kill me.  </p>
<p>Three years ago, when I was walking on a corridor in a building, I was caught by a man. Even at this moment, I don't know who he is. But I thing I am sure: I became painful when I keep alive.  </p>
<p>You may ask me. Why don't I kill myself? Uh huh. Something is stopping from doing this.</p>
