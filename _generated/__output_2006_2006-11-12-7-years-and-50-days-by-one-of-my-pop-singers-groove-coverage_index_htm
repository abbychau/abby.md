Title: 7 Years and 50 Days<br />
Lyrics:<br />
7 Years and 50 Days, the time is passing by,<br />
nothing in this world could be,as nice as you and I.<br />
And how could we break, up like this,<br />
and how could we be wrong,so many years,so many days,<br />
and I still sing my song.  </p>
<p>Now I run to you,like I always do,<br />
when I close my eyes,and think of you,<br />
such a lonely girl,such a lonely world,<br />
when I close my eyes I dream,<br />
I return to you,like I always do,<br />
when I close my eyes and think of you,<br />
such a lonely girl,such a lonely world,<br />
when I close my eyes I dream,of you.  </p>
<p>7 years and 50 days,<br />
now just look at me,am I the girl,<br />
I used to be,so damn what do you see.  </p>
<p>And how could we break,up like this,<br />
and how could we be wrong,so many years,<br />
so many days,and I still sing my song.  </p>
<p>Now I run to you,like I always do,<br />
when I close my eyes and think of you,<br />
such a lonely girl,such a lonely world,<br />
when I close my eyes I dream,<br />
I return to you,like I always do,<br />
when I close my eyes and think of you,<br />
such a lonely girl,such a lonely world,<br />
when I close my eyes I dream,of you.  </p>
<p>7 Years and 50 Days, the time is passing by,<br />
nothing in this world could be,as nice as you and I.  </p>
<p>And how could we break, up like this,<br />
and how could we be wrong,<br />
so many years,so many days,and I still sing my song.  </p>
<p>Now I run to you,like I always do,<br />
when I close my eyesand think of you,<br />
such a lonely girl,such a lonely world,<br />
when I close my eyes I dream,I return to you,like I always do,<br />
when I close my eyes and think of you,<br />
such a lonely girl,such a lonely world,<br />
when I close my eyes I dream,of you.  </p>
