Music surrounds me on this special night<br />
I find myself getting lost in the moment<br />
'Cause she's there dancing and you're in my sight  </p>
<p>You're stepping along<br />
Can't get my eyes off of you<br />
Then I see you're looking back . at me<br />
Could this be what I think it is?<br />
Can feel my heart beat like a new butterfly  </p>
<p>I know you've got to be the one<br />
I could tell when our eyes met each other<br />
I can't sit down my knees are feelin' weak<br />
As I feel myself at last  </p>
<p>You've got the cutest little smile<br />
We can tell there's attraction going on now<br />
Shows you're all that I need<br />
One by one<br />
For our love<br />
You are my prince charming<br />
And you make me feel like I am a KIMONO♥PRINCESS  </p>
<p>I'm not dreaming<br />
I know you've got to be the one<br />
I could tell when our eyes met each other<br />
I can't sit down my knees are feelin' weak<br />
And I feel myself at last  </p>
<p>You've got the cutest little smile<br />
We can tell there's attraction going on now<br />
Shows you're all that I need<br />
One by one<br />
For our love<br />
You are my prince charming<br />
And you make me feel like I am a KIMONO♥PRINCESS</span></p>
