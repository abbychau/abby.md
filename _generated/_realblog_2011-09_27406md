<p>I want to start to write diary once again.</p>
<p>morning: some surfing before leaving</p>
<p>noon: I went to arcade during lunch time for DDR</p>
<p>night: no home dinner again but hotpot in a restaurant</p>
<p>night2: played LOL and with a 20/4/13 cho'gath and turn out a lose, teammates and I are not pushy so they are safe for the whole game.</p>
<p>plan: found a bms player source code in both java and c++ and I am going to dive into one of them soon</p>
